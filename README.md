My Smart Agriculture project focuses on developing an  App for beginner farmers who lack sufficient financial resources and farming knowledge. The app will provide location-based crop recommendations, helping farmers decide which crops are suitable for their area. It will guide them on whether to sell crops now or hold them, showing the current market price and predicted prices for the next 7 days.

Farmers can upload crop images to detect plant diseases, along with information on the cause, prevention, and future actions. The app will also include a market area feature, providing details about high-demand crops like tomatoes and potatoes and nearby vegetable markets.

To encourage users, the app will share real farmer success stories and offer guidance on irrigation, fertilization, and modern farming practices. Additionally, it will help students and individuals choose suitable plants for plantation based on their local area.
